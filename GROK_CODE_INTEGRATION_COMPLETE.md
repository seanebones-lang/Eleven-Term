## 📦 Components Available from Grok-Code

The following components are available in the cloned repository and can be adapted:

1. **Orchestrator Logic** (`src/lib/orchestrator.ts`) - Task analysis and agent routing
2. **Agent Orchestrator** (`src/lib/agent-orchestrator.ts`) - Multi-agent coordination
3. **Agent Tools Catalog** (`src/lib/agent-tools-catalog.ts`) - Tool definitions
4. **Agent Memory** (`src/lib/agent-memory.ts`) - Memory management for agents
5. **Agent Loop** (`src/lib/agent-loop.ts`) - Agent execution loop
6. **Specialized Agents** (`src/lib/specialized-agents.ts`) - ✅ Already integrated

## 🎯 Next Steps

The system now has all agents locally and no longer needs to call Vercel for agent definitions.
All agents are available through the orchestrator and can be auto-assigned based on task keywords.

## 📝 Notes

- All agent descriptions match the Grok-Code repository definitions
- Agents are integrated into `DEFAULT_CONFIG['specialized_agents']`
- The orchestrator can auto-assign agents based on task keywords
- All 50 tools are available to all agents
